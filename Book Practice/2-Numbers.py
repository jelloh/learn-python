# ------- Mathematical Operators ------------
# ** --> exponent such as 2**4 for 2^4
# +  --> add
# -  --> subtract
# *  --> multiply
# /  --> divide

# Supports order of operations, so...
# 2 + 3 * 4 equals 14, not 24

print(3/2) # prints 1.5
print((int)(3/2)) # prints 1
print((float)(3/2)) # prints 1.5

# Page 31
# Mentions numbers like:
# 0.2 + 0.1 => 0.3000000000000000000004
# Says we will learn how to deal with this later.

#message = "Happy " + age + "rd Birthday!" # <- this doesn't work!!
message = "Happy " + str(age) + "rd Birthday!" # str(age) converts int to string

print(message)
#print("Happy " + age + "rd Birthday!") # This also doesn't work without
                                        # the conversion.

# SO COOL. THIS DISPLAYS A TON OF STUFF.
